Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock price performance of blockchain-based companies,"The price of a stock rises or falls in relation to a number of differ- ent factors, including changes to the economy brought about by pandemics. A few studies have already identified the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market. However, empirical evi- dence is lacking on changes in stock price performance of block- chain-based companies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use the event study approach to estimate stock expected returns by applying an asset pricing model over a thirty-day event win- dow around the announcement on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the outbreak of the corona- virus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic, using a sample of S&P Global 1200 companies. Overall, our results indicate more sensitiv- ity in blockchain-based companies’ stock prices to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those of non-blockchain-based compa- nies. Cumulative abnormal returns show that the stock price of blockchain-based companies recover losses slower than non- blockchain companies. Our findings are important for investors and shareholders for future pandemics and events."
Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Life of Higher Education Students: A Global Perspective,"The paper presents the most comprehensive and large-scale study to date on how students perceive the impacts of the first wave of COVID-19 crisis in early 2020 on various aspects of their lives on a global level. With a sample of 30,383 students from 62 countries, the study reveals that amid the worldwide lockdown and transition to online learning students were most satisfied with the support provided by teaching staff and their universities’ public relations. Still, deficient computer skills and the perception of a higher workload prevented them from perceiving their own improved performance in the new teaching environment. Students were mainly concerned about issues to do with their future professional career and studies, and experienced boredom, anxiety, and frustration. The pandemic has led to the adoption of particular hygienic behaviours (e.g., wearing masks, washing hands) and discouraged certain daily practices (e.g., leaving home, shaking hands). Students were also more satisfied with the role played by hospitals and universities during the epidemic compared to the governments and banks. The findings also show that students with certain socio-demographic characteristics (male, part-time, first-level, applied sciences, a lower living standard, from Africa or Asia) were significantly less satisfied with their academic work/life during the crisis, whereas female, full-time, first-level students and students faced with financial problems were generally affected more by the pandemic in terms of their emotional life and personal circumstances. Key factors influencing students’ satisfaction with the role of their university are also identified. Policymakers and higher education institutions around the world may benefit from these findings while formulating policy recommendations and strategies to support students during this and any future pandemics."

People are concerned about their lives, jobs, savings, and investments. This paper had analyzed the changes in the mutual fund industry in India due to the virus outbreak from December 2019 to May 2020. A sample of 25 equity-oriented direct growth funds has been considered for this study to analyze their performance along with the sector-wise differences. The results show that the value of majority of the funds had plunged, while some funds had rebounded during the period."
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Malaysia: A Critical Survey,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak was discovered in Malaysia on January 25, 2020, it has impacted many aspects of Malaysian life, including health, lifestyle, and economic changes. As a result, this study was carried out to conduct a more thorough investigation into the problems and effects experienced by the public in Malaysia as a result of the disease outbreak. The study was conducted for six months, from January 2020 until June 2020, and 100 people were chosen randomly as the study sample. The method employed online questionnaires administered via the Google Forms platform. Based on the study’s results, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the community’s physical and mental health, especially among students and employees. COVID-19 also affects peoples’ lifestyles, and many have difficulties adapting to the new norms, as these changes involve how people socialize, learn, and work. The study also found that COVID-19 also negatively impacts the economy of individuals, communities, and countries, based on the current spending of Malaysian society and the affected industrial and worker conditions."
"Long, medium, and short-term effects of COVID-19 on mobility and lifestyle","The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and causes over 2 million deaths worldwide (by January 2021). Besides the public health crisis, the infection affected the global economy as well. It also led to change in people's lifestyles, amount of teleworking and teleshopping, mode choice preference, the value of time, etc. In addition to these short-term changes during the COVID-19 outbreak, this drastic transformation of the world might account for the potentially disruptive medium- and long-term impacts. Recognizing the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial in mitigating the negative behavioral changes that directly relate to psychological well-being. It is important to stress that citizens and government face an uncertain situation since nobody knows the exact parameters, which explain congestion or when the vaccine will be distributed (and its efficiency, for example, with respect to mutations). The major sources of uncertainty in the context of mobility, which have an impact on short-run (route, departure time, and mode used), medium-run (car ownership), and long-run (location of job, residential location, and choice of job) mobility, are mostly listed in this paper."
"The COVID-19: BUSINESS TRENDS, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES","Population of every economy of the world consists of both men and women. Women are an integral part of every economy and empowering them is essential to promote economic development. When there is a Development that happens in economy it happens when both men and women work together and enjoy equal status in the society to bring affluence. But the access to the resources among men and women vary all over the world and this difference of resource access is more evident in developing nations. In developing countries, there are structural impediments that prevent and keep women from contributing in the decision making process. This unprivileged status of women is the due to multiple factors such as illiteracy, joblessness, early marriages and familial violence which have prohibited women from attaining greater elevation. Further, they are financially and as well as socially reliant on the masculine member of the family. They don’t enjoy the same standing as men in many aspects. It is considered that women earn less than men and hence have less prospect for growth. Considering women in the society she is always granted the secondary role in the family. Through they are aware about the gender in equalities, women are trying to overcome them. Considering property and legal rights women have very limited access to them such as land water and other natural resources. Lack of understanding of various laws of legislation and very poor enactment of these laws has reduced the competence of women to raise their voice for their rights and also gives raise to three factors that becomes the basis for women disempowerment. The first basis is women having lesser job opportunities, the second is having not considered to take up decision or withdrawing decision making power or can make benefits which should lead for benefiting of others first. The aim of empowering women is to equally distribute the power between both the Genders. Both genders (men and women) should always be benefited with equal economic, political and legal, and social rights for their development on every aspects. When considered women empowerments, this can be achieved by increasing their rights towards taking decision, and their capacity towards taking decision, their dignity, their choices and voices, their opportunities and power towards achieving their rights. As women starts to participate in the economic activities, it reduces scarcity in the economy which results in increased fabrication through women who can support their families and can also become owners of property and can accelerate growth. This will surely bring development in the economy."
